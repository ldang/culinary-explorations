### Introduction
[Baozi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baozi) is a type of steamed bun or bread.  Some of the most recognizable baozi are the fluffy white pork buns you can find in Chinese grocery stores or the golden brown sweet baked pork buns that you might get at dim sum.  There are also buns with sweet fillings like red bean or lotus paste.  There is a particularly interesting one with an egg custard filling that can have the consistency of runny egg yolk.

Baozi show up in other countries, under different names and are made with different cooking techniques and fillings.  

### Dough

Baozi can be made with a variety of dough recipes.  If you aren't a stickler for tradition, you can also tried ready-made biscuit doughs or pizza doughs.  Just avoid anything super-yeasty or sourdough-y.  The buns tend to be mild in flavor and are sometimes lightly sweetened.

The fluffy white bao dough can be made with a recipe as simple as water, yeast, and all-purpose flour.   (You may go for a Hong Kong flour or a Korean flour if you want something finer-milled.)  Some recipes add milk and sugar, which may make for a softer white dough.  Still others use both yeast and baking soda. Some add a little vinegar to make the dough whiter.  

If you want to make a baked baozi, the dough requires milk, butter (or some form of fat), and eggs. An eggwash or a honey glaze helps make for a brown bun.  A milk bread recipe would be a good candidate.

There is a variety of baozi that is more like a dumpling.  This includes the famous XLB (xiao long bao) soup dumplings and Tibetan momos.  In this case, the dough is probably just flour and water.  


### Cooking techniques

Traditionally, we steam baozi for about 15 minutes if there is no filling and 20 minutes if there is a filling.  Sometimes the filling is precooked.  Sometimes, it is not.  It is essential that the filling be fully cooked by the time the dough finishes cooking.  Additionally, Steamed buns are really soft and moist just out of the steamer, but they can become dry after they cool down.  A juicy, flavorful filling will make all the difference.

Buns can also be baked.  It usually requires a different dough and an eggwash or some kind of glaze to get it nice and brown.  It's probably easiest to bake them in a muffin pan using cupcake liners.  See relevant recipe for times and temperatures.

There is a Shanghai style of cooking the buns that involves frying and then steaming them.
